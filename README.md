### About Me
- I'm a masters student in Biomedical Informatics at Stony Brook University
- Interested in large language models and their application in bioinformatics
  - My capstone project is using [DNABERT-S](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08777) to build better metagenomics tools and learn more about the human microbiome
- I'm currently looking for an internship in bioinformatics or data science for summer 2025

### My repositories
- Here I have various individual and university projects that I've worked on throughout the years
- [DNABERT-S Weighted Sum Pooling Implementation](https://github.com/jaaxk/DNABERT_SM) is a project that implements a learned global attention network to generate weights for each token-level embedding before pooling together to understand which parts of the sequence are more meaningful for species discrimination.
- [COMEBERT](https://github.com/jaaxk/COMEBin-DNABERT2) is a combination of the metagenomics binning program, COMEBin, and the pretrained DNA language models, DNABERT (1, 2, and S). My modification replaces tetra-nucleotide frequency embeddings with different DNABERT embeddings, and comebines them with sequencing depth information to bin sequences in an unsupervised manner.
- [EmerGNN model](https://github.com/jaaxk/EmerGNN-model) was a graduate project that allowed me to learn more about graph neural networks and [web development](https://github.com/Orbin-Ahmed/EmergnnWebUI)
- [Lineup reader website](https://github.com/jaaxk/Lineup-Reader-Website) was an individual project to self-learn web development using Flask
- [My Neural Network Implementation](https://github.com/jaaxk/My-Neural-Network-Implementation) was an individual project to learn about OOP, and various deep learning optimizers, loss functions, and preprocessing techniques
- [Lysis-lysogeny gene model](https://github.com/jaaxk/Lysis-Lysogeny-Stochastic-Model) was an undergraduate project to model gene expression of bacteriophages and helped me learn about statistical methods like Monte-Carlo simulations
